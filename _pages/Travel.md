All participants should plan to arrive in Cape Town on Sunday, 25 May 2025, the day before the workshop begins. Accommodation has been arranged at the Batavia Boutique Hotel in Stellenbosch, with check-in available from the afternoon of the 25th. The workshop will conclude on Friday, 30 May, with check-out on the morning of Saturday, 31 May 2025.

### Airport Transfers
To assist with transport from Cape Town International Airport (CPT) to Stellenbosch, we have arranged three scheduled coach transfers on 25 May. Exact departure times will be shared closer to the date, but participants are encouraged to align their flight arrivals accordingly. 

If your flight does not align with one of the scheduled coaches, you will need to arrange your own transportation to the hotel. For those arranging their own transport, taxis and rideshare services (e.g., Uber and Bolt) are readily available at the airport, and the drive to Stellenbosch typically takes around 35â€“45 minutes depending on traffic.

Similarly, on Saturday, 31 May, three return coaches will take participants back to Cape Town International Airport from the hotel. Again, participants whose flights fall outside the coach schedule will be responsible for their own transfers.

### Accommodation

All workshop attendees will be staying at:

> Batavia Boutique Hotel<br>
> 12 Louw Street, Stellenbosch Central<br>
> Stellenbosch, 7600, South Africa<br>
> bataviaboutiquehotel.com<br>

Breakfast will be included, and the hotel is within walking distance of the workshop venue at the Stellenbosch Institute for Advanced Study.

If you have any questions about your travel itinerary or arrival times, please get in touch with the organising team in advance.
